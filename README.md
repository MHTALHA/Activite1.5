The login page is the basic requirement for membership-based websites.

User needs to login to the website using its username or email and password to access the website. If the user has not logged out but the SESSION is destroyed then it needs to again login to the website.

By adding remember me on the login form the user needs to checked the remember me checkbox and login to the website. Now if the user has not logged out but the SESSION is destroyed.

When the user again accesses the website then it does not need to login and the SESSION is initiated.
